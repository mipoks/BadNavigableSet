# MyNavigableSet

This Java Class implements interface SortedSet.
This Java Class was written during the lesson at the university. I strongly do not recommend using this code in your real projects. Using this Class can cause errors and bugs at runtime.


## Usage

```markdown

Creating Class Instance

MyNavigableSet<Smth extends Comparable> thisSet = new MyNavigableSet<>();

```
